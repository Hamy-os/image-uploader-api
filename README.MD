# Image Uploader

Let's see if i've learnt enough to make one :)

## Structure of the project

- Server
|- responsible for the api
- Dashboard
|- responsible for the frontend

## TODO ( for now )

- [ ] Create a POST route /api/upload that accepts a file and returns a json response with the url of the image
- [ ] Create a POST route /api/delete that accepts a url and deletes the image
- [ ] Create a GET route /api/images that returns a json response with all the images
